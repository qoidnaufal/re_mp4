# MP4 parser

`re_mp4` is a Rust library for reading `.mp4` files.

Originally a fork of [mp4](https://crates.io/crates/mp4). Some code was ported from [mp4box.js](https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js).

The goal behind forking was to make this library suitable for use with the [`WebCodecs`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) API to build Rust-based video players for the web.
